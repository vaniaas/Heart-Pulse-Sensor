This repository contains the Heart Pulse Sensor project using Arduino, designed to detect and record heartbeats in real-time. 

Key Features:
Uses a heart rate sensor to capture signals
Displays results on an LCD screen or Serial Monitor
Can be further developed for advanced health monitoring systems

Wiring:

**Pulse Sensor**  
- `+` → 5V  
- `-` → GND  
- `S` → A0  

**LCD I2C**  
- `GND` → GND  
- `VCC` → 5V  
- `SDA` → A4  
- `SCL` → A5
